Hello everybody, here I keep my code developed during the second (optional) challenge from Ignite platform (rocketseat). I refactored a webpage that shows movies and filter them by genre. The project uses typescript and sass. The template was simple and beautiful, but after refactoring the components I wanted to let the application more unique, so I change the colors, I apply the responsiveness besides to create a dinamic page to receive json data from `state` property in Link. The routes was built with `react-routes-dom`.

## Status

🚀 ...released... 🚀

## Requirements and How to use

To run this application locally you just need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer. By doing that npm (node package manager) will be installed too. So know you can start the application by running:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Then start the json-server
npm run server

# Start the application
npm run dev

```

If you prefer you can run by using `yarn` instead:

```bash
# Install yarn in computer globally
npm install yarn --global

# Install all dependencies with yarn
yarn

# Then start the json-server
yarn server


# Start the application with yarn
yarn dev

```
